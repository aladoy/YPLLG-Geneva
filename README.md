# YPLLG-Geneva
The repository contains the codes and datasets used in the manuscript "Geographic footprints of life expectancy inequalities in the state of Geneva, Switzerland".

*Important note*: We have not uploaded the complete mortality dataset used in the analyses and most intermediate data (`processed_data/` folder) to Github in order to comply with the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (Art. 22).
Consequently, several codes (`src/`) cannot be fully executed.
However, to still give the readers an idea of the dataset used, we have uploaded protected versions of the raw dataset (`data/death_notices/Datas_csv_excel_protected.csv`) and the one used for spatial analyses (`processed_data/final_dataset_spatial_analysis_protected.gpkg`), where the values of the attributes that allow for the identification of deceased (e.g., first name, last name, address, birth date) have been replaced by 'Protected'.
